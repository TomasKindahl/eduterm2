# Eduterm/2

This is a clone of [vain's][vain] ([Peter Hofmann's][phoff]) [eduterm], used by myself to develop terminal functionality in [kr√•kfot][krakfot]. To honor vain's contribution, I keep his MIT license. But don't nag on him to fix errors in my clone!

My plan is to redevelop eduterm/2 to use a real text line buffer (in opposition to a height/width square letter drawing area matrix), as well as modularize it rather than writing naked bytes to allocated memory.

## Documentation from uninformativ.de

Learning what's going on behind the scenes in X11 terminal emulators.

This is for educational purposes.


## Installation

The following C libraries are required:

- libx11

To build the program, run:

    make

You really should read the source code.

## Running

Open a new terminal window:

    eduterm

If you use a tiling window manager, make sure that you're in "floating" mode.
