# Eduterm/2

This is a clone of [vain's][vain] ([Peter Hofmann's][phoff]) [eduterm], used by myself to develop terminal functionality in [kr√•kfot][krakfot]. To honor vain's contribution, I keep his MIT license. But don't nag on him to fix errors in my clone!

My plan is to redevelop eduterm/2 to use a real text line buffer (in opposition to a height/width square letter drawing area matrix), as well as modularize it rather than writing naked bytes to allocated memory.

Learning what's going on behind the scenes in X11 terminal emulators.

This is for educational purposes.


## Installation

The following C libraries are required:

- libx11

To build the program, run:

    make

You really should read the source code.

## Running

Open a new terminal window:

    eduterm

If you use a tiling window manager, make sure that you're in "floating" mode.
